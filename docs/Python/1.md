# Getting Started

!!! note
    This article is about setting up Python development.

!!! warning
    Some of the document below is copied from `https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-install.html`, greatly appreciated.

!!! warning
    I would recommend to use `git` along with `github` to manage your Python code.

    Guide Here: `https://www.runoob.com/git/git-install-setup.html`

## Windows Platform

Installing Python on Windows is recommended to be done through the Visual Studio.

!!! note
    This method is recommended because Visual Studio comes with better support when updating Python, also it helps setup environment variables automatically.

Other recommended ways to install Python on Windows are:

1. Through official release on `https://www.python.org/downloads/`
2. Through `winget` command:
    ```
    winget install python
    ```

    !!! note
        `winget` is a command line tool that comes with Windows 10/11, see `https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/package-manager/winget/`

3. Through Windows Store.

    (**Least recommended** due to update and environment variable reasons)

!!! Warning
    Setting up environment variables:

    See article `https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-install.html`

    You might want to set this **NOW**, otherwise you might run into errors.


## macOS Platform

Recommended way to install Python on macOS is through `homebrew`:

```bash
brew install python
```
!!! note
    `brew` is a package manager for macOS, see `https://brew.sh/`

!!! note
    Installing `git` is the same, simply run `brew install git`.

## Linux Platform

See your Linux distribution's documentation for how to install Python.

Take Ubuntu as an example:

```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

!!! note
    `git` should already be installed on your system, if not, run `sudo apt install git` to install it.


## IDE environments

### Visual Studio Code

!!! note
    `Visual Studio Code` is a powerful IDE for Python development.
    It comes with a lot of features, including syntax highlighting, code completion, and more.
    It is recommended to use it for **ALL** Python development.

You can download it from `https://code.visualstudio.com/download`

!!! note
    `Visual Studio Code` is available as a command line tool, you can run it by typing `code` in your terminal.

    You can also install it through `npm`: `npm install -g code`

### Pycharm

!!! note
    `Pycharm` is great for starters, but it is not recommended for large-scale Python development, mainly because lack of extensions support.

    That is to say, if you want a simple guide-free Python environment setup, you can use `Pycharm` to get started.

    You can download it from `https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/`
