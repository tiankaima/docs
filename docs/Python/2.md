# Basic Grammar

    This article is about basic Python grammar.

## Variable types:

> One should always start with learning the variable types.

In Python, there are six main types of variables:

* `number`: number
* `str`: string
* `list`: list
* `tuple`: tuple
* `set`: set
* `dict`: dictionary

Let's start one by one:

### `number` type

In Python, `number` type is used to represent all kinds of numbers,including `integers`, `floats`, and `complex numbers`, as well as `bool`.

#### SubNote I - `type()` and `isinstance()`

!!! note
    In order to find out the type of variable, type `type(variable)` to find out:

```python
>>> type(3.0)
<class 'float'>
```
!!! warning
    Another method to determine what kind of variable is is to use `isinstance()`:

```python
>>> isinstance(3.0,float)
True
```

!!! warning
    There's a difference between `isinstance()` and `type()`:

    However, you won't encounter the problem until you learn `class`.

    For further answers, see [here](about:blank), right now you can consider the following as true:

```python
isinstance(_variable,_type)
# equals to
type(_variable) == _type
```

    Need to replace the link!

#### Basic operations

`number` type has the following arithmetic operations:

* `add`: `+`
* `subtract`: `-`
* `multiply`: `*`

> The three functions above will only return `int` when two `int` are given, otherwise it will return `float`, or `complex`.

* `divide`: `/` (This will return a `float`, even the result is an integer):

```python
>>> 4/2
2.0
```

* `floor division`: `//` (This will return an integer):

```python
>>> 5//3
1
```

* `modulo`: `%` (This will return an integer):

```python
>>> 5%3
2
```

* `power`: `**`

```python
>>> 2**3
8
```

---
#### SubNote II - `type` "conversion" and assigning

!!! Tip
    Python supports assigning two variables at the same time:

```python
a,b=1,2
```

!!! Tip
    Like a scripting language, Python support changing variable types, just assign whatever you want to the variable:

```python
a=1 # a is now an integer
a='hello' # a is now a string
```

!!! error
    Although the example given is legal, **DO NOT USE PYTHON LIKE THAT.**

---
#### Complex type

!!! Tip
    `Complex` type is usually ignored in most getting-started document.

    However, it's something quite interesting and new(?) in computer science.

!!! note
    In Python, the notation for imaginary number is `j`, NOT `i`(in some countries are taught as `i`).

An example:

```python
>>> 1+2j
(1+2j)
```

Arithmetic operations on `complex` type are the "same" as other `number`

!!! note
    `floor division` and `modulo` are not supported in `complex` type, no matter the position.

    This will result in a `TypeError`:

```python
>>> 1//2j
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for //: 'int' and 'complex'
```

!!! Tip
    **ALL** arithmetic operations on `complex` type will return `complex` type:

```python
>>> (1.0+4j)+(1.0-4j) 
(2+0j)
>>> (1.0+4j)/(1.0-4j) 
(-0.8823529411764706+0.47058823529411764j)
>>> (5+3j)**(2+3j)
(6.694563360967683+0.585212825721j)
```

Complex numbers have some unique properties:
