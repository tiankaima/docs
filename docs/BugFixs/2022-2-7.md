While using `electron-ssr` an error was spotted, feedbacks were:

```text
Thread **** could not be stopped, turn down manually
```

Log feedbacks are:

```python
Getting AttributeError: module 'collections' has no attribute 'MutableMapping' while using any pip3 command on linux Python 3.10
```

This error further triggers the electron-side to other problems.

## Problem addressing:

!!! note
    This might be a common issue with updating from Python3.9 to Python3.10.

The script reported the error was located here:`~\AppData\Roaming\electron-ssr\shadowsocksr\shadowsocks\lru_cache.py`

Line 44, problem occurs here:

```python
class LRUCache(collections.MutableMapping):
```

To fix, thanks to [an answer from stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69512672/getting-attributeerror-module-collections-has-no-attribute-mutablemapping-w), is to change the line into:

```python
class LRUCache(collections.abc.MutableMapping):
```

Please notice that on stackoverflow, the highlighted answer is NOT correct, the problem could not be fixed updating pip.

## Further actions:

!!! note
    This solution is implemented in PR here: https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/pull/1489, although this PR could never be merged because of some obvious reasons.
