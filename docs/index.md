## Developers wanted

!!! note
    You can contribute to this site by adding your own markdown page to [this repo](https://github.com/tiankaima/docs), just make a PR and I'll get in touch with you.

I had a dream to build a forum-like discussion website for developers to exchange their ideas, without ads or anything.

But everything comes with a cost, so instead, I made this Github Page site, hoping to publish some of the work I'm focusing on, and if that inspires you, even a bit, I hope you can give me a star for that :(

## Update Log:

**2022/3/9 Log**: Add Giscus Support

You can now use Giscus to comment on the bottom of the page.

Also Github Action bot is enabled, so you don't have to run the build code on my own computer...LOL

**2022/2/7 Log**: Basic framework setup.

TODO List:

1. add `requirement.txt` and keep maintenance
2. Change a bit UI to make it look better ..?
