# TianKaiMa's Blog

... Just another develope's blog when he codes.

## Github Page Site: `https://tiankaima.github.io/docs`

Uh... the documentation covers a lot of different areas, some I didn't spend much time on, so there might be mistakes or errors.

If you are glad to help, please comment on that site, or bring a issue on this repo. That will be a great favor to me.

## GuideLines for commenting

You can, obviously express your comment about my docs or the content I'm writing, but please take enough care with the words you are using, especially words that might be considered offensive or impolite.

If you came across a comment you find intolerable, bring up a issue and I'll give it a check.

## Help wanted

Although this is just a simple blog site for most of you, I do hope that someone joins me in this process.

You can put your own document on my repo(create a PR!), or point out the mistakes I'm making in this repo.
